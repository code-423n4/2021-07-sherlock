# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos:

- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. (We'll set that one up later.)

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Contest scoping

Sherlock is a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that protects Decentralized Finance (DeFi) users from exploits with proprietary security analysis and protocol-level coverage.

There are 3 main participants in the Sherlock ecosystem:

- Protocols accrue debt to the solution over time, in return, their end users are compensated in case of an exploit at protocol level.
- Stakers provide capital to the solution, their capital is used in case of an exploit payout. In return for the risk they are rewarded SherX, a token which can be redeemed for underlying protocol premium tokens.
- Security team (watsons) is a decentralized group incentivized to keep protocols safe and signal protocol premium pricing to the Sherlock DAO.

Sherlock V1 (solution) is built using Diamonds (EIP 2535), basically meaning all the contracts in the `facets` folder live at the same address and share the same storage. The solution is ERC20 compatible, the ERC20 exposed functions are defined in `facets/SherXERC20.sol`.

Natspec comments can be read from the `interfaces` folder.

## Areas of concern

- The payout function is long and complex
- Redeeming SHERX
- `_doYield()` function in the SherX facet.
- The different functions for updating premiums and token pricing. Focussing on economic exploits.
